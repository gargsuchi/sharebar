<h2>Vas ist das?</h2>

<p>The Drupal Module Upgrader (DMU) is a module that converts Drupal 7 modules to Drupal 
8.</p>

<h2>Using DMU</h2>

<p>Currently, the only way to run DMU is as a Drush command. Put your D7 module directly
in your <code>modules</code> directory -- not a subdirectory -- and enable DMU. Then run
<code>drush dmu-upgrade target_module</code>. If there's no output, it means everything
worked. If you look at your module now, you should see at least a .info.yml file there --
and, unless you've got a <em>really</em> simple module, a few other things.</p>

<p>For all its awesomeness, DMU isn't omnipotent. There are things it can't effectively
convert. For example, if your implementation of <code>hook_menu()</code> contains logic --
an <code>if</code> statement, <code>switch</code> statement, or function call -- DMU
will fail with an error, because it cannot effectively trace your module's logic. You'll
need to convert it manually.</p>

<h2>How didst thou this sorcery?</h2>

<p>DMU works by running plugins, each of which is responsible for changing some 
specific piece of the module's code. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A plugin to convert the legacy .info format used by Drupal 7 into the .info.yml
  format used by Drupal 8, removing values that no longer exist.
  (<code>src/Plugin/DMU/Module/InfoToYAML.php</code>).</li>
  <li>There's a plugin that converts simple implementations of <code>hook_menu()</code>
  -- the ones that don't have any special logic -- to various YAML files, converting the
  callback functions into methods in a controller class
  (<code>src/Plugin/DMU/Module/HookMenu.php</code>).</li>
  <li>There are plugins to convert <code>hook_init()</code> and <code>hook_exit()</code>
  to callback methods in event subscriber classes
  (<code>src/Plugin/DMU/Module/HookInit.php</code>
  and <code>src/Plugin/DMU/Module/HookExit.php</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Like any other plugin, DMU converters have full access to the Drupal API, and if you
run the DMU under Drush (and at the time of this writing, that's the only way to run DMU),
you get the Drush API as well. They're implemented using the core plugin system, so you
can obviously write your own.</p>

<p>All plugins receive an instance of <code>Drupal\drupalmoduleupgrader\ModuleContext</code>.
This object contains the state of the module being converted (i.e., various public properties
for plugins to manipulate), plus helpful utility methods for plugins to use.</p>

<p>To analyze, parse, and modify PHP code, DMU relies on 
<a href="https://github.com/grom358/pharborist">Pharborist</a>, which it installs as
a dependency via Composer. Pharborist parses PHP code into an <dfn>abstract syntax tree</dfn>,
which can then be crawled through and modified in a very jQuery-ish way. If you write
a conversion plugin that needs to rewrite PHP code in any way (or, for that matter, move
functions around), you'll need Pharborist.</p>

<h2>Writing DMU plugins</h2>

<p>First, you need to decide what kind of plugin to write. There are several 
types, each of which lives in a particular namespace and may implement a 
particular interface. All DMU plugins must ultimately implement
<code>Drupal\drupalmoduleupgrader\Converter\ConverterInterface</code>, which 
may itself be extended by some plugin types, in order to define methods specific 
to that type.</p>

<p>Without further ado, the DMU plugin type buffet:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Module Converters</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      <code>Plugin\DMU\ModuleWide</code> namespace
    </p>
    <p>
      Module converters act on the module as a whole, and are generally run only once
      per module. An example of a module converter is a hook converter -- modules
      implement hooks only once, so a hook converter should only run once per module.
      This is the only plugin type that can be specifically enabled or disabled with
      the <code>--only</code> and <code>--skip</code> options of
      <code>drush dmu-upgrade</code>.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Route Converters</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      <code>Plugin\DMU\Routing</code> namespace
    </p>
    <p>
      These plugins convert individual <code>hook_menu()</code> items to routes. They're
      also responsible for generating controller classes and moving functions around, as
      needed. These plugins are identified by the name of the D7 page callback function
      that they handle -- for example, the <code>drupal_get_form</code> route converter
      will convert menu items that call <code>drupal_get_form()</code>. Route converters
      are delegated as needed by the <code>HookMenu</code> plugin.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Function Replacement</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      <code>Plugin\DMU\FunctionReplacement</code> namespace
    </p>
    <p>
      These plugins do exactly what you think: rewrite function <strong>calls</strong>. 
      Like route converters, they're also identified by the name of the Drupal 7 
      function they handle.
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Parametric Rewriters</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      <code>Plugin\DMU\ParametricRewriter</code> namespace
    </p>
    <p>
      These are intelligent search-and-replace plugins that act on a complete function.
      To illustrate, consider this fairly useless function:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
function get_uid($account) {
  $uid = $account->uid;
}
    </code></pre>
    <p>That first line is problematic in Drupal 8, because to access entity IDs you now
    use <code>$entity->id()</code>, not direct property access. But just making a grep
    target isn't going to suffice here, because there is too much we don't know. When DMU
    looks at this, it has no way to tell exactly what <code>$account</code> is. And for
    that matter, what if it were named something different, like <code>$user_account</code>?
    Grep is too dumb to work out these kinds of distinctions, so we need something smarter.</p>
    <p>A parametric rewriter is that something. When you use one, you essentially
    tell it, &quot;Okay -- I'm telling you that the first parameter of this function is a 
    user account. Now rewrite the function as needed.&quot; Armed with that information, 
    the  rewriter can trawl through the function and make the appropriate changes,
    depending on the data type. Parametric rewriters are also smart enough to handle
    getting (as in the above example) and setting (<code>$node->title = 'Foobaz'</code>)
    differently. There are different parametric rewriters to handle different data
    types; the ID of a parametric rewriter plugin is the type of data it handles, like
    &quot;node&quot; or &quot;user&quot;, although it doesn't <em>have</em> to be an
    entity type.</p> 
  </dd>
</dl>
<h2>Annotation Structure</h2>
<p>Plugins are annotated as <code>@Converter</code> blocks, with the following keys:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>id</dt>
  <dd>
    The plugin ID (all plugins in Drupal 8 have one). The ID is meaningful
    to DMU, depending on what type of plugin you're writing.
  </dd>
  <dt>description</dt>
  <dd>
    A short, translated description of what the plugin does.
  </dd>
  <dt>change_notice</dt>
  <dd>
    The node ID of a change notice on drupal.org which explains more about the changes
    the plugin makes. This key is technically optional, but you should strive to include
    it wherever possible. It can be an array if more than one change notice applies.
  </dd>
  <dt>message</dt>
  <dd>
    The default (translated) message to be displayed if the issue handled by the 
    plugin is detected by the <code>dmu-analyze</code> command.
  </dd>
  <dt>delegator (optional)</dt>
  <dd>
    Some plugins use <dfn>delegates</dfn>, i.e., other plugins which do some work on
    behalf of the parent plugin. If a plugin needs to use delegates, it can specify
    the ID of the delegate plugin manager service here, which will be provided
    to the parent plugin as <code>$this->delegator</code>.
  </dd>
  <dt>hook (optional)</dt>
  <dd>
    If the plugin converts a specific hook, specify that hook here, without
    the hook_ prefix. This only applies to module converters that extend
    <code>Drupal\drupalmoduleupgrader\Converter\HookConverterBase</code>, and
    is ignored for other plugin types.
  </dd>
</dl>
<h2>A few words on function replacement...</h2>
<p>Not every function replacement needs a full-fledged FunctionReplacement plugin. In
many cases, Drupal 7 functions have merely been renamed. If you find yourself needing
to convert one of those, breathe a sigh of relief, then keep calm and add it as a target
for the Grep plugin :) More about that will be added soon; for now, look at grep.json, 
in the DMU root directory. You'll figure it out in a jiffy.</p>
<p>So when <em>do</em> you need to write a FunctionReplacement plugin? Easy: when you're
rewriting a function call whose arguments, or entire structure, has changed. For 
example, let us consider the venerable <code>user_access()</code> function, called
thusly in Drupal 7:</p>
<pre><code>user_access('break stuff');</code></pre>
<p>In Drupal 8, it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>\Drupal::currentUser()->hasPermission('break stuff');</code></pre>
<p>It looks intimidating, but this is a simple renaming. Both calls have the same number
of arguments, of the same type. The only thing that's changed is everything before the
opening parenthesis. So this conversion involves nothing more than adding a new target
for the Grep plugin to deal with.</p>
<p>So let's turn up the heat and consider the equally venerable 
<code>variable_get()</code>. In Drupal 7:</p>
<pre><code>variable_get('pants_type', 'mchammer');</code></pre>
<p>And in Drupal 8:</p>
<pre><code>\Drupal::config('pants.settings')->get('pants_type');</code></pre>
<p>Right there, we see a number of major differences. <code>variable_get()</code> has
no idea what <code>pants.settings</code> is, and the <code>get()</code> method doesn't 
accept a default value for the second argument -- that's expected to be in a YAML file 
in the module's <code>config/install/pants.settings.yml</code> file. This is a function 
call that cries out plaintively for a plugin (and it has one; see 
<code>src/Plugin/DMU/FunctionReplacement/VariableGet.php</code>.</p>
